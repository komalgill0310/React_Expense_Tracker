# **Summary**
<font size=5>

* This application allows the user to write and save their expenses by clicking  **Add a new Expense** button. 
* This is my very first application created using React. Once I implemented props, functional components, useState and useEffect, I was thoroughly impressed by what React could do. I also like how convenient Bootstrap classes, which I can use for styling in React.

* **Tools Used:** 
  * useState
  * useEffect 
  * Local Storage
  * props
  * Functional Components
  * onClick EventListener
